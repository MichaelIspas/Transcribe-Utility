Transcribe Utility is a desktop application that transcribes video and audio files
into text using the faster-whisper Python library derived from OpenAI Whisper. 
The application features a user-friendly GUI to allow users to select video/audio files, 
initiate transcription, and save results to .txt and .srt files with time stamps.
