Transcribe Utility Design Document

Overview
The Transcribe Utility is a desktop application that transcribes audio files
into text using the faster-whisper Python library. The application features a
user-friendly GUI to allow users to select audio files, initiate transcription,
and save results to .txt files with time stamps. Future enhancements will
feature .srt subtitle output conversion from text files. The design prioritizes
modularity for future expansion.

Objectives
1. Provides an intuitive interface for selecting and transcribing audio files
2. Generate accurate transcriptions with time stamps using faster-whisper's 
    tiny.en model for minimal setup for English.
3. Save transcriptions to .txt files, with plans for .srt support
4. Support batch processing of up to five audio files for minimal processing speed
5. Include cancel functionality to stop transcription and clean up temporary and
    unfinished files.
6. Modularity is prioritized with separate GUI and transription logic.

System Architecture
1. main.py: Implement Tkinter GUI to handle user interactions for file selection
    and display transcription results.
2. transcription.py: Process faster-whisper transcription logic.

1. GUI via Tkinter
    1. Menu toolbar for basic functions
    2. Display blank to five files on cover of software if file(s) selected or not
    3. "Transcribe" button to start event
    4. "Cancel" button next to "Transcribe" button to cancel event and 
        remove created .txt file(s) (until I implement .txt to .srt functionality)
